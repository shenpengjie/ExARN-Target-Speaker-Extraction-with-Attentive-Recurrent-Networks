# ExARN-Target-Speaker-Extraction-with-Attentive-Recurrent-Networks
## Guides
This is a project focused on target speaker extraction which is based on pytorch.This paper's primary contributions are twofold: First, it presents a novel attentive fusion module, specifically tailored to enhance the efficiency of using registered speaker information, with the added benefit of significantly reducing computational and parameter requirements relative to the conventional HMSA. Second, it demonstrates that our method surpasses the benchmark model in addressing the SC challenge, achieving superior performance on the wsj0-2mix-extr dataset.
